# DataStructures_Java

Data Structures and Algorithms in Focus:

1. Insertion, Selection, and Merge Sort
2. Linked List (Singly & Doubly)
3. Dynamic arrays (Stack, Queue)
4. Heap Sort, and Hashing (Hash Map) algorithm
5. Graph Algorithm and Dijkstra's Shortest path Algorithm

- These are the data structures and algorithm that had be done in Java and calculate all of these algorithm's time complexity and space complexity 
on the online software by providing a dynamic text file.
